## Issues

If you find any weird colors or combinations, feel free to open an issue on [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/Nico4devv/ezcord-theme/issues).

Also do that if you find a crazy pink color anywhere, I used that one (#ff00dd) if I haven't found out where it's applied :D

## Fonts

I use Fira Code with a font weight of 400 for the Theme.
If you download it and install it on your machine, you can set it in your settings.json like this:

```json
{
  "editor.fontFamily": "Fira Code",
  "editor.fontWeight": "400",
  "editor.fontLigatures": true
}
```
